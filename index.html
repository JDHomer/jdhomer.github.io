                    <p>Hi there. I'm Jiadi Hou and I come from China.</p>
                    <p>I was born in Changchun, a peaceful and quite capital city of Jilin Province. It's in the northeast part of China, which means it is very cold in winter. The temperature can be as low as -35 &#176;C (or -31 &#176;F) and the snow can accumulate to as high as my knee!</p>
                    <p>Unlike the cold weather in my hometown, I'm an enthusiastic person! I love solving challenging problems and I'm motivated to learn new skills and techniques. At this moment, I'm learning to use HTML and CSS to build this personal page. As I have little experience developing the front end, I encountered lots of obstacles. Most of the problems are how to properly place and align elements on a page. It's not an easy task but through searching and trials and errors, I gradually know more about the language and its components. And when I solve the problem, it feels awesome! It's a lot of fun exploring what I can achieve with new and known skills.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy interacting with computers. It brings me sense of accomplishment when I give orders to the computer, especially when tons of tasks may take me several days by hand, the computer can finishes them in a blink! That's one of the reasons, and the most important one, why I love coding: it makes our life easier.</p>
